# One-Click-Windows-Cache-Cleaner-
A small collection of Windows cleanup utilities (batch scripts) to quickly remove common temporary files and run Disk Cleanup. The primary script included is `Clean All.bat`, which clears Prefetch, system TEMP folders, the current user's %TEMP% folder, and then runs Windows Disk Cleanup (cleanmgr).
